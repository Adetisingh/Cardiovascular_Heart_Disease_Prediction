# Cardiovascular_Heart_Disease_Prediction
The goal of this project is to predict if an individual is suffering from cardiovascular heart disease and comparing three models:






 - Logistic Regression
 - Decision Tree
 - K-Nearest Neighbour





   These three models need to be compared to predict the results of comparison with better accuracy.











  The Dataset used is taken from Kaggle.
