# Cardiovascular_Heart_Disease_Prediction
The goal of this project is to predict if an individual is suffering from cardiovascular heart disease and comparing three models:
-Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbour
  These three models need to be compared to predict the results of comparison with better accuracy.
  The Dataset used is taken from Kaggle.
